    This ePortfolio documents my complete journey through the <em>Security and Risk Management</em> module,
    covering Units 1‚Äì12 of the MSc Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online.
    It consolidates foundational and advanced themes ‚Äî from definitions of risk, the Risk Management Process (RMP),
    and assessment methods (qualitative, quantitative, and hybrid) to applied threat modelling
    using STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, and attack trees. Further sections explore regulatory frameworks and standards
    (GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000 series), quantitative risk modelling (Monte Carlo, Bayes, AHP methods),
    and the integration of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) planning.
    The final units evaluate emerging and future trends in SRM through research, debate, and reflection.
  </p>

  <p>
    The portfolio also includes formative artefacts, seminar insights, collaborative discussions, and
    both summative assessments ‚Äî demonstrating applied knowledge, critical evaluation, and professional
    growth across the entire module.

      <p><strong>Initial Post by Pragadheesh Marimuthu ‚Äì Monday, 11 August 2025 (09:16 AM)</strong></p>
      <p>
        When I read <em>Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em>, I found their explanation of
        Industry 4.0 quite interesting. They describe it as the fourth industrial revolution,
        where advanced digital technologies are built into how industries work every day. It is not
        just about automation anymore; it is about using the Internet of Things (IoT),
        artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, and big-data analytics to create smarter
        and more efficient processes. A simple example could be a factory that uses IoT sensors to
        monitor machines and automatically adjust production if something is not running smoothly.
        Another one is predictive maintenance, where machines get serviced before they break down
        because the data shows early warning signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, all of this comes with risks. Cybersecurity is one that stands out the most for me.
        The more connected everything is, the more chances there are for hackers to find a way in.
        The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021 showed how one successful attack can cause
        massive disruption. Another risk lies in the supply chain ‚Äì Industry 4.0 systems depend on
        real-time automated logistics, and if one part fails the whole system can be affected.
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage of semiconductors stopped or slowed production in
        many industries, which is a clear example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also came across another study by <em>Frank et al. (2019)</em> that supports what
        <em>Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó</em> are saying. They agree that Industry 4.0 can make
        companies more competitive, but it also means strong security and reliable supply-chain
        planning are essential. This makes me think that the real challenge is not just adopting these
        technologies but ensuring that risks are managed from day one.
      </p>

    <p>
      The introductory seminar outlined the overall structure of the <em>Security and Risk Management</em>
      module, focusing on how the twelve units build from foundational theory to advanced quantitative
      modelling and applied risk analysis. The tutor emphasised that this module bridges technical
      cybersecurity practice with enterprise-level risk strategy, helping students link vulnerabilities
      to organisational resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were introduced to the three main assessments: the <strong>Team Project ‚Äì Risk Identification Report</strong>,
      the <strong>Individual Executive Summary</strong>, and the <strong>Final e-Portfolio</strong>. Each is designed to
      demonstrate different dimensions of our understanding‚Äîcollaboration, analytical modelling, and reflection.
      The seminar also explained the importance of version control using GitHub for assessment submission and
      evidence archiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Team formation and the <strong>Group Contract</strong> were key discussion points. The tutor highlighted professional
      conduct, equitable contribution, and communication as essential to successful collaboration.
      We were advised to agree early on project roles, communication platforms, and meeting schedules.
    </p>
    <p>
      A critical takeaway from this session was that <strong>risk management is proactive, not reactive</strong>.
      Instead of treating security as a final layer, it should be embedded throughout project design.
      This perspective framed the rest of the module‚Äôs learning, particularly how assessment
      and mitigation processes fit within organisational governance frameworks.

        <p><strong>Initial Post Summary ‚Äì Miriam Mahabiersing (10 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Miriam summarised <em>Kovaitƒó &amp; Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em> and <em>Li (2024)</em>, outlining
          Industry 4.0 technologies, risk categories, and comparative frameworks like FARE vs MCDM.
          Her examples of Equifax (2017) and the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica case highlighted
          real-world data-privacy and financial risks.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My Response ‚Äì Pragadheesh Marimuthu (12 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Your post gave a clear breakdown of how <em>Kovaitƒó &amp; Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em> define
          Industry 4.0 and its associated risks. The real-world cases you mentioned, particularly the
          Equifax breach and the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica incident, are strong illustrations of
          how data-security failures escalate into financial and reputational damage. These examples
          emphasise that technical measures alone are insufficient ‚Äî organisational culture,
          transparent communication, and staff training are equally vital.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found your comparison between the FARE and fuzzy MCDM approaches insightful. Combining both
          could create a more robust framework that supports risk categorisation and prioritisation.
          Emerging regulations such as the EU AI Act could further influence these dynamics by shaping
          operational and ethical standards for Industry 4.0 adoption.

        <p><strong>Initial Post Summary ‚Äì Tenny Akindulureni (6 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Tenny‚Äôs post described how Industry 4.0 technologies like cloud services and IoT help SMEs
          overcome geographical barriers, while also identifying major technical and financial risks.
          Referencing <em>Pfeifer (2021)</em>, he noted that structured frameworks may still fail if
          implementation challenges are overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My Response ‚Äì Pragadheesh Marimuthu (12 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          You‚Äôve provided a concise explanation of Industry 4.0, linking its core technologies to new
          opportunities for SMEs. The risks you identified are realistic and well supported by
          <em>Kovaitƒó &amp; Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em>. I appreciate your use of Pfeifer‚Äôs (2021)
          case study, which adds depth by showing that not all risks can be mitigated even with formal frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          To strengthen resilience, SMEs could adopt phased implementation strategies and prioritise
          staff training and change-management support to enhance competence and acceptance.
          Your balanced view of both benefits and limitations is a strong example of critical evaluation.

      <div style="margin-top:10px;">
        <p>
          The seminar explored how <strong>AI-powered data analytics</strong> can enhance qualitative and quantitative
          risk assessment. Referring to <em>Spears &amp; Barki (2010)</em>, the tutor illustrated how mixed-methods approaches
          combine expert judgement with data-driven insight for more balanced risk evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussion focused on integrating multiple AI technologies beyond NLP‚Äîsuch as machine learning for anomaly detection and
          predictive analytics for continuity planning. These methods enable proactive risk forecasting and resource prioritisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The session emphasised that AI should augment rather than replace human decision-making. User participation remains essential to
          ensure that automated systems align with organisational context and ethical principles. The key takeaway was that effective
          SRM depends on a balance between technological innovation and human oversight.

    This unit clarified the difference between threats and vulnerabilities and introduced core threat-modelling
    approaches such as <strong>STRIDE</strong>, <strong>DREAD</strong>, <strong>attack trees</strong> and the hybrid

      <div style="margin-top:10px;">
        <p>
          When I first read <em>Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em>, what stood out to me was how Industry 4.0 is not just
          about automation but about creating fully connected, data-driven systems using IoT, AI and big data. In my initial
          post I used examples like IoT sensors for predictive maintenance, because they clearly show how technology can
          improve efficiency. I also felt the risks were just as important, particularly cybersecurity and supply-chain
          issues. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack (2021) showed how one breach can cause widespread disruption,
          and the semiconductor shortages during COVID-19 highlighted how supply chains can stall production across
          industries (Frank et al., 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          The feedback I received helped me expand on these points. Marina added more detail on cybersecurity, pointing to
          <em>Culot et al. (2019)</em>, who recommend layered defences such as network segmentation and intrusion detection.
          She also suggested supply-chain diversification and predictive analytics (<em>Oztemel and Gursev, 2020</em>),
          which made me think more about proactive planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In responding to Miriam and Tenny, I linked their ideas back to what we covered in Units 1 and 2. Miriam‚Äôs
          comparison of the FARE method with Li‚Äôs (2024) fuzzy MCDM approach reminded me that the type of risk assessment
          used ‚Äî whether qualitative or quantitative ‚Äî makes a big difference. <em>Spears and Barki (2010)</em> also
          discuss this in relation to user participation in the Risk Management Process. Tenny‚Äôs focus on SME challenges
          connected well with the idea that involving staff and stakeholders is essential for making risk-management
          processes work in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Unit 3‚Äôs introduction to threat modelling such as STRIDE and PASTA showed me how risks can be mapped
          in a structured way. Overall, the discussion made me realise that adopting Industry 4.0 is not only about having
          advanced technology but also about building resilience through risk assessment, planning, and involving people
          at every stage.

  <h3>Focus</h3>
  <p>
    This unit introduced key <strong>security and risk standards</strong> that shape enterprise-level
    assessments and compliance planning. It explored the <strong>GDPR, PCI-DSS</strong>, and the
    <strong>ISO/IEC 27000 family</strong> as reference frameworks for managing information security,
    data privacy, and operational resilience.
    The aim was to evaluate how standards translate into practical controls and risk-management
    processes within different organisational contexts.

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Case Study:</strong> Alleged disclosure of CCTV footage from a State-run accommodation centre

    <summary>üìò View Case Study Analysis</summary>
    <div class="cs" style="margin-top:10px;">
      <h4>Specific GDPR Articles and Issues</h4>
      <p>
        The DPC determined breaches under the <em>Data Protection Acts 1988 & 2003</em> (now aligned with the GDPR),
        highlighting failures to maintain lawful processing and adequate safeguards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section 4:</strong> No timely response to the subject‚Äôs access request (exceeding 40 days).</li>
        <li><strong>Section 2(1)(d):</strong> Insufficient security measures to prevent unauthorised disclosure.</li>
        <li><strong>Sections 2C(2) & 2C(3):</strong> Absence of a written processor agreement between the
            <em>Reception and Integration Agency (RIA)</em> and <em>Aramark</em>, breaching Article 28 GDPR
            principles of controller‚Äìprocessor responsibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Findings and Outcome</h4>
      <p>
        Both entities failed to demonstrate accountability or implement risk-based technical and
        organisational measures. The DPC concluded that unclear roles, lack of encryption, and missing
        audit trails directly violated data-minimisation and integrity principles.
        Although the footage‚Äôs external transmission could not be proven, the systemic absence of policy
        controls and documentation was itself deemed a GDPR violation.
      </p>

      <h4>Recommended Remediation (as Information Security Manager)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Formalise <strong>Data-Processing Agreements (DPAs)</strong> defining controller and processor duties.</li>
        <li>Adopt <strong>role-based access control</strong> (RBAC), CCTV encryption, and secure transfer protocols.</li>
        <li>Implement <strong>incident-response playbooks</strong> and <strong>subject-access workflows</strong> to meet statutory timelines.</li>
        <li>Provide <strong>GDPR awareness training</strong> to all staff and contractors handling personal data.</li>
        <li>Schedule <strong>periodic internal audits</strong> and <strong>data-flow mapping</strong> to verify ongoing compliance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        This case reinforced the importance of aligning everyday operational practices with formal standards.
        It demonstrated that compliance is not only legal adherence but a foundation for <em>trust,
        accountability, and organisational resilience</em>. The exercise also deepened understanding of
        how frameworks like GDPR intersect with ISO 27001‚Äôs continuous-improvement model to strengthen
        governance maturity.

        The <strong>Unit 6 seminar ‚Äì Security Standards</strong> translated theoretical frameworks into 
        <em>practical risk-management actions</em>. The tutor emphasised that GDPR, PCI-DSS and ISO 27001 
        should function as interconnected components of a single governance model rather than isolated checklists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discussion centred on the importance of documented policies, regular audits, and
        <strong>evidence-based compliance</strong>. Real audit-failure examples highlighted how inadequate
        data-processing agreements and weak access controls breached GDPR Articles 5 and 32. The class also mapped 
        risk registers to ISO 27001 Annex A clauses to show how these underpin continuous improvement 
        and stakeholder assurance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the seminar reinforced that mature risk management depends on a 
        <em>culture of compliance</em>‚Äîwhere policy, technology, and people align to build sustainable security resilience.

      <h2>Reflective Summary (Units 1‚Äì6)</h2>
      <p>
        Across Units 1‚Äì3 I moved from foundation concepts to method selection: distinguishing risk
        definitions, weighing qualitative vs quantitative assessments, and appreciating how user participation
        surfaces operational realities that impact the RMP. In Units 4‚Äì6, hands-on modelling (STRIDE/DREAD/attack
        trees/PASTA) and compliance framing (GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000) helped me connect technical threats to
        business standards and control requirements. Watching seminar recordings let me pause/rewind complex
        sections and translate them into actionable artefacts. Key improvements ahead: deepen CVSS scoring
        practice, prototype hybrid modelling templates for repeatable analysis, and maintain a live standards
        checklist tied to business context and data flows.

  <h3>Focus</h3>
  <p>
    This unit introduces the principles and practice of <strong>Quantitative Risk Modelling (QRM)</strong> 
    and explains how numerical analysis supports decision-making in Security and Risk Management (SRM). 
    It demonstrates how probabilistic and statistical techniques such as <em>Monte Carlo simulations</em>, 
    <em>Bayes‚Äô Theorem</em>, and <em>multi-criteria models</em> (AHP, TOPSIS, ANP) are used to evaluate 
    and prioritise risks. Students explore the transition from qualitative frameworks (like STRIDE or DREAD) 
    to data-driven analysis that expresses uncertainty, probability, and potential loss.
  </p>

  <h3>Intended Learning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain the benefits and limitations of quantitative risk modelling approaches.</li>
    <li>Build and test a simple Monte Carlo simulation to estimate probability and impact of risks.</li>
    <li>Apply Bayesian reasoning and multi-criteria models (AHP / TOPSIS / ANP) to prioritise mitigations.</li>
    <li>Interpret quantitative outputs such as mean, standard deviation, and percentiles to inform decisions.</li>
    <li>Critically discuss transparency and assumptions in QRM design and implementation.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Tutor highlight:</strong> Quantitative models must remain 
    <em>traceable</em> and <em>transparent</em>. Each probability, distribution, 
    or weight should be justified with data or literature, and assumptions 
    documented beside the results for clarity and reproducibility.

      <p><strong>Initial Post ‚Äì Pragadheesh Marimuthu (7 October 2025)</strong></p>

      <p>
        Over the past few weeks, I joined this discussion later than I initially planned because of other coursework 
        and professional tasks. The delay, however, allowed me to go through the material from Units 7 to 9 with a clearer 
        understanding of how quantitative risk models are applied in cybersecurity. Reading Spring et al. (2021) 
        was an eye-opener for me, as it changed the way I looked at vulnerability scoring systems such as 
        the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). I realised that the scoring process is not as objective 
        or reliable as I once believed, and that a lot of interpretation and context are involved in how risks are rated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before reading the article, I assumed CVSS was a universal, trustworthy method of quantifying software vulnerabilities. 
        However, Spring et al. (2021) highlight several weaknesses in the system. They point out that CVSS simplifies 
        a wide range of technical details and business impacts into a single number, which can lead to misunderstandings 
        and inaccurate prioritisation. The authors also note that CVSS depends heavily on human judgment, meaning that two analysts 
        can assign different scores for the same vulnerability (Allodi and Massacci, 2014). This makes the results inconsistent 
        and sometimes unreliable for decision-making in large organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another major problem is that CVSS does not evolve over time. Once a vulnerability is scored, the number remains static 
        even when new exploits appear or patches are released (Gallon, 2019). In today‚Äôs fast-paced IT environments, this limitation 
        can cause organisations to rely on outdated information when making important security decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        I agree with the critique presented by Spring et al. (2021). Although CVSS can be a useful starting point, it often gives 
        a false sense of accuracy. Studies such as those by Sabottke, Suciu and Dumitra»ô (2015) show that there is little correlation 
        between CVSS scores and how often vulnerabilities are actually exploited in the real world. This means that an organisation 
        may focus on vulnerabilities that look serious on paper while missing those that pose real business risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the alternatives discussed, I find the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC) method much more practical. 
        It allows different groups such as vendors and asset owners to make risk-based decisions using tailored decision trees 
        (Spring, Hatleback and Householder, 2021). SSVC also fits well with ISO/IEC 27005 principles of continuous risk assessment 
        (Aven and Thekdi, 2024), making it a more flexible and transparent way to prioritise vulnerabilities.
