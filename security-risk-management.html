    This ePortfolio documents my complete journey through the <em>Security and Risk Management</em> module,
    covering Units 1‚Äì12 of the MSc Cybersecurity programme at the University of Essex Online.
    It consolidates foundational and advanced themes ‚Äî from definitions of risk, the Risk Management Process (RMP),
    and assessment methods (qualitative, quantitative, and hybrid) to applied threat modelling
    using STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, and attack trees. Further sections explore regulatory frameworks and standards
    (GDPR, PCI-DSS, ISO 27000 series), quantitative risk modelling (Monte Carlo, Bayes, AHP methods),
    and the integration of Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) planning.
    The final units evaluate emerging and future trends in SRM through research, debate, and reflection.
  </p>

  <p>
    The portfolio also includes formative artefacts, seminar insights, collaborative discussions, and
    both summative assessments ‚Äî demonstrating applied knowledge, critical evaluation, and professional
    growth across the entire module.

      <p><strong>Initial Post by Pragadheesh Marimuthu ‚Äì Monday, 11 August 2025 (09:16 AM)</strong></p>
      <p>
        When I read <em>Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em>, I found their explanation of
        Industry 4.0 quite interesting. They describe it as the fourth industrial revolution,
        where advanced digital technologies are built into how industries work every day. It is not
        just about automation anymore; it is about using the Internet of Things (IoT),
        artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, and big-data analytics to create smarter
        and more efficient processes. A simple example could be a factory that uses IoT sensors to
        monitor machines and automatically adjust production if something is not running smoothly.
        Another one is predictive maintenance, where machines get serviced before they break down
        because the data shows early warning signs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, all of this comes with risks. Cybersecurity is one that stands out the most for me.
        The more connected everything is, the more chances there are for hackers to find a way in.
        The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack in 2021 showed how one successful attack can cause
        massive disruption. Another risk lies in the supply chain ‚Äì Industry 4.0 systems depend on
        real-time automated logistics, and if one part fails the whole system can be affected.
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, the shortage of semiconductors stopped or slowed production in
        many industries, which is a clear example of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also came across another study by <em>Frank et al. (2019)</em> that supports what
        <em>Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó</em> are saying. They agree that Industry 4.0 can make
        companies more competitive, but it also means strong security and reliable supply-chain
        planning are essential. This makes me think that the real challenge is not just adopting these
        technologies but ensuring that risks are managed from day one.
      </p>

  <div style="margin-top:10px;">
    <p>
      The introductory seminar outlined the overall structure of the <em>Security and Risk Management</em>
      module, focusing on how the twelve units build from foundational theory to advanced quantitative
      modelling and applied risk analysis. The tutor emphasised that this module bridges technical
      cybersecurity practice with enterprise-level risk strategy, helping students link vulnerabilities
      to organisational resilience.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were introduced to the three main assessments: the <strong>Team Project ‚Äì Risk Identification Report</strong>,
      the <strong>Individual Executive Summary</strong>, and the <strong>Final e-Portfolio</strong>. Each is designed to
      demonstrate different dimensions of our understanding‚Äîcollaboration, analytical modelling, and reflection.
      The seminar also explained the importance of version control using GitHub for assessment submission and
      evidence archiving.
    </p>
    <p>
      Team formation and the <strong>Group Contract</strong> were key discussion points. The tutor highlighted professional
      conduct, equitable contribution, and communication as essential to successful collaboration.
      We were advised to agree early on project roles, communication platforms, and meeting schedules.
    </p>
    <p>
      A critical takeaway from this session was that <strong>risk management is proactive, not reactive</strong>.
      Instead of treating security as a final layer, it should be embedded throughout project design.
      This perspective framed the rest of the module‚Äôs learning, particularly how assessment
      and mitigation processes fit within organisational governance frameworks.

        <p><strong>Initial Post Summary ‚Äì Miriam Mahabiersing (10 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Miriam summarised <em>Kovaitƒó &amp; Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em> and <em>Li (2024)</em>, outlining
          Industry 4.0 technologies, risk categories, and comparative frameworks like FARE vs MCDM.
          Her examples of Equifax (2017) and the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica case highlighted
          real-world data-privacy and financial risks.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My Response ‚Äì Pragadheesh Marimuthu (12 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Your post gave a clear breakdown of how <em>Kovaitƒó &amp; Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em> define
          Industry 4.0 and its associated risks. The real-world cases you mentioned, particularly the
          Equifax breach and the Facebook‚ÄìCambridge Analytica incident, are strong illustrations of
          how data-security failures escalate into financial and reputational damage. These examples
          emphasise that technical measures alone are insufficient ‚Äî organisational culture,
          transparent communication, and staff training are equally vital.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found your comparison between the FARE and fuzzy MCDM approaches insightful. Combining both
          could create a more robust framework that supports risk categorisation and prioritisation.
          Emerging regulations such as the EU AI Act could further influence these dynamics by shaping
          operational and ethical standards for Industry 4.0 adoption.

        <p><strong>Initial Post Summary ‚Äì Tenny Akindulureni (6 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          Tenny‚Äôs post described how Industry 4.0 technologies like cloud services and IoT help SMEs
          overcome geographical barriers, while also identifying major technical and financial risks.
          Referencing <em>Pfeifer (2021)</em>, he noted that structured frameworks may still fail if
          implementation challenges are overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My Response ‚Äì Pragadheesh Marimuthu (12 Aug 2025)</strong></p>
        <p>
          You‚Äôve provided a concise explanation of Industry 4.0, linking its core technologies to new
          opportunities for SMEs. The risks you identified are realistic and well supported by
          <em>Kovaitƒó &amp; Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em>. I appreciate your use of Pfeifer‚Äôs (2021)
          case study, which adds depth by showing that not all risks can be mitigated even with formal frameworks.
        </p>
        <p>
          To strengthen resilience, SMEs could adopt phased implementation strategies and prioritise
          staff training and change-management support to enhance competence and acceptance.
          Your balanced view of both benefits and limitations is a strong example of critical evaluation.

        <p>
          The seminar explored how <strong>AI-powered data analytics</strong> can enhance qualitative and quantitative
          risk assessment. Referring to <em>Spears &amp; Barki (2010)</em>, the tutor illustrated how mixed-methods approaches
          combine expert judgement with data-driven insight for more balanced risk evaluation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussion focused on integrating multiple AI technologies beyond NLP‚Äîsuch as machine learning for anomaly detection and
          predictive analytics for continuity planning. These methods enable proactive risk forecasting and resource prioritisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The session emphasised that AI should augment rather than replace human decision-making. User participation remains essential to
          ensure that automated systems align with organisational context and ethical principles. The key takeaway was that effective
          SRM depends on a balance between technological innovation and human oversight.

    This unit clarified the difference between threats and vulnerabilities and introduced core threat-modelling
    approaches such as <strong>STRIDE</strong>, <strong>DREAD</strong>, <strong>attack trees</strong> and the hybrid

      <div style="margin-top:10px;">
        <p>
          When I first read <em>Kovaitƒó and Stankeviƒçienƒó (2019)</em>, what stood out to me was how Industry 4.0 is not just
          about automation but about creating fully connected, data-driven systems using IoT, AI and big data. In my initial
          post I used examples like IoT sensors for predictive maintenance, because they clearly show how technology can
          improve efficiency. I also felt the risks were just as important, particularly cybersecurity and supply-chain
          issues. The Colonial Pipeline ransomware attack (2021) showed how one breach can cause widespread disruption,
          and the semiconductor shortages during COVID-19 highlighted how supply chains can stall production across
          industries (Frank et al., 2019).
        </p>
        <p>
          The feedback I received helped me expand on these points. Marina added more detail on cybersecurity, pointing to
          <em>Culot et al. (2019)</em>, who recommend layered defences such as network segmentation and intrusion detection.
          She also suggested supply-chain diversification and predictive analytics (<em>Oztemel and Gursev, 2020</em>),
          which made me think more about proactive planning.
        </p>
        <p>
          In responding to Miriam and Tenny, I linked their ideas back to what we covered in Units 1 and 2. Miriam‚Äôs
          comparison of the FARE method with Li‚Äôs (2024) fuzzy MCDM approach reminded me that the type of risk assessment
          used ‚Äî whether qualitative or quantitative ‚Äî makes a big difference. <em>Spears and Barki (2010)</em> also
          discuss this in relation to user participation in the Risk Management Process. Tenny‚Äôs focus on SME challenges
          connected well with the idea that involving staff and stakeholders is essential for making risk-management
          processes work in practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Unit 3‚Äôs introduction to threat modelling such as STRIDE and PASTA showed me how risks can be mapped
          in a structured way. Overall, the discussion made me realise that adopting Industry 4.0 is not only about having
          advanced technology but also about building resilience through risk assessment, planning, and involving people
          at every stage.

  <h3>Focus</h3>
  <p>
    This unit introduced key <strong>security and risk standards</strong> that shape enterprise-level
    assessments and compliance planning. It explored the <strong>GDPR, PCI-DSS</strong>, and the
    <strong>ISO/IEC 27000 family</strong> as reference frameworks for managing information security,
    data privacy, and operational resilience.
    The aim was to evaluate how standards translate into practical controls and risk-management
    processes within different organisational contexts.

  <div class="callout">
    <strong>Case Study:</strong> Alleged disclosure of CCTV footage from a State-run accommodation centre

    <summary>üìò View Case Study Analysis</summary>
    <div class="cs" style="margin-top:10px;">
      <h4>Specific GDPR Articles and Issues</h4>
      <p>
        The DPC determined breaches under the <em>Data Protection Acts 1988 & 2003</em> (now aligned with the GDPR),
        highlighting failures to maintain lawful processing and adequate safeguards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Section 4:</strong> No timely response to the subject‚Äôs access request (exceeding 40 days).</li>
        <li><strong>Section 2(1)(d):</strong> Insufficient security measures to prevent unauthorised disclosure.</li>
        <li><strong>Sections 2C(2) & 2C(3):</strong> Absence of a written processor agreement between the
            <em>Reception and Integration Agency (RIA)</em> and <em>Aramark</em>, breaching Article 28 GDPR
            principles of controller‚Äìprocessor responsibility.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Findings and Outcome</h4>
      <p>
        Both entities failed to demonstrate accountability or implement risk-based technical and
        organisational measures. The DPC concluded that unclear roles, lack of encryption, and missing
        audit trails directly violated data-minimisation and integrity principles.
        Although the footage‚Äôs external transmission could not be proven, the systemic absence of policy
        controls and documentation was itself deemed a GDPR violation.
      </p>

      <h4>Recommended Remediation (as Information Security Manager)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Formalise <strong>Data-Processing Agreements (DPAs)</strong> defining controller and processor duties.</li>
        <li>Adopt <strong>role-based access control</strong> (RBAC), CCTV encryption, and secure transfer protocols.</li>
        <li>Implement <strong>incident-response playbooks</strong> and <strong>subject-access workflows</strong> to meet statutory timelines.</li>
        <li>Provide <strong>GDPR awareness training</strong> to all staff and contractors handling personal data.</li>
        <li>Schedule <strong>periodic internal audits</strong> and <strong>data-flow mapping</strong> to verify ongoing compliance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Reflection</h4>
      <p>
        This case reinforced the importance of aligning everyday operational practices with formal standards.
        It demonstrated that compliance is not only legal adherence but a foundation for <em>trust,
        accountability, and organisational resilience</em>. The exercise also deepened understanding of
        how frameworks like GDPR intersect with ISO 27001‚Äôs continuous-improvement model to strengthen
        governance maturity.

  <h3>Focus</h3>
  <p>
    This unit introduces the principles and practice of <strong>Quantitative Risk Modelling (QRM)</strong> 
    and explains how numerical analysis supports decision-making in Security and Risk Management (SRM). 
    It demonstrates how probabilistic and statistical techniques such as <em>Monte Carlo simulations</em>, 
    <em>Bayes‚Äô Theorem</em>, and <em>multi-criteria models</em> (AHP, TOPSIS, ANP) are used to evaluate 
    and prioritise risks. Students explore the transition from qualitative frameworks (like STRIDE or DREAD) 
    to data-driven analysis that expresses uncertainty, probability, and potential loss.
  </p>

  <h3>Intended Learning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Explain the benefits and limitations of quantitative risk modelling approaches.</li>
    <li>Build and test a simple Monte Carlo simulation to estimate probability and impact of risks.</li>
    <li>Apply Bayesian reasoning and multi-criteria models (AHP / TOPSIS / ANP) to prioritise mitigations.</li>

      <p><strong>Initial Post ‚Äì Pragadheesh Marimuthu (7 October 2025)</strong></p>

      <p>
        Over the past few weeks, I joined this discussion later than I initially planned because of other coursework 
        and professional tasks. The delay, however, allowed me to go through the material from Units 7 to 9 with a clearer 
        understanding of how quantitative risk models are applied in cybersecurity. Reading Spring et al. (2021) 
        was an eye-opener for me, as it changed the way I looked at vulnerability scoring systems such as 
        the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). I realised that the scoring process is not as objective 
        or reliable as I once believed, and that a lot of interpretation and context are involved in how risks are rated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before reading the article, I assumed CVSS was a universal, trustworthy method of quantifying software vulnerabilities. 
        However, Spring et al. (2021) highlight several weaknesses in the system. They point out that CVSS simplifies 
        a wide range of technical details and business impacts into a single number, which can lead to misunderstandings 
        and inaccurate prioritisation. The authors also note that CVSS depends heavily on human judgment, meaning that two analysts 
        can assign different scores for the same vulnerability (Allodi and Massacci, 2014). This makes the results inconsistent 
        and sometimes unreliable for decision-making in large organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another major problem is that CVSS does not evolve over time. Once a vulnerability is scored, the number remains static 
        even when new exploits appear or patches are released (Gallon, 2019). In today‚Äôs fast-paced IT environments, this limitation 
        can cause organisations to rely on outdated information when making important security decisions.
      </p>

      <p>
        I agree with the critique presented by Spring et al. (2021). Although CVSS can be a useful starting point, it often gives 
        a false sense of accuracy. Studies such as those by Sabottke, Suciu and Dumitra»ô (2015) show that there is little correlation 
        between CVSS scores and how often vulnerabilities are actually exploited in the real world. This means that an organisation 
        may focus on vulnerabilities that look serious on paper while missing those that pose real business risks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Among the alternatives discussed, I find the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC) method much more practical. 
        It allows different groups such as vendors and asset owners to make risk-based decisions using tailored decision trees 
        (Spring, Hatleback and Householder, 2021). SSVC also fits well with ISO/IEC 27005 principles of continuous risk assessment 
        (Aven and Thekdi, 2024), making it a more flexible and transparent way to prioritise vulnerabilities.

        Although no separate artefact files were produced for this unit, the exercise conceptually modelled 
        a risk scenario using <strong>Monte Carlo simulation principles</strong>. The objective was to estimate 
        the probability of on-time project delivery under variable uncertainty factors.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:6px;">

      <p>
        Developing a conceptual understanding of Monte Carlo and Bayesian methods strengthened my grasp of 
        quantitative risk modelling. I learned how uncertainty can be expressed numerically and how distributions 
        provide richer insights than single deterministic values. Unlike qualitative frameworks that rely on 
        categorical judgments, QRM forces a transparent look at assumptions and variability. 
        Even without running full simulations, the exercise clarified how probabilistic thinking can guide 
        better prioritisation of controls and resource allocation. It also emphasised that quantitative results 
        must always be accompanied by clear explanations so that both technical and managerial audiences 
        can interpret the implications accurately.

  <div class="callout" style="margin-top:10px">
    <p><strong>Summary of Omar‚Äôs Post:</strong>  
      Omar critically examined the weaknesses of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), noting its focus on technical severity, 
      static scoring, and lack of contextual consideration. He supported replacing CVSS with the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability 
      Categorisation (SSVC), which uses decision trees and tailored priorities to guide more realistic vulnerability management decisions.
    </p>
    <p><strong>My Response:</strong>  
      You gave a clear and well-balanced summary of the main weaknesses of CVSS highlighted by Spring et al. (2021), 
      especially the lack of context and the issue of static scoring.  
      I agree that vulnerability management is not just about technical severity but also about timing, available resources, 
      and how the system is used in the real world.  
      The inconsistencies noted by Allodi and Massacci (2012) show that even experienced assessors can score the same vulnerability 
      differently, making CVSS less reliable for consistent decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      I liked how you explained the advantages of SSVC. Using decision trees that consider factors such as exploitation activity, 
      mission impact, and system exposure makes the approach more practical and transparent. It also fits with ISO/IEC 27005, 
      which promotes ongoing risk reassessment as conditions change (Aven and Thekdi, 2024).
    </p>
    <p>
      One idea that could strengthen your argument is to mention how SSVC might be used alongside data-based models like EPSS. 
      This combination could help organisations not only prioritise based on context but also consider the real probability 
      of exploitation. Overall, your post gives a strong case for replacing CVSS with SSVC and shows how context-aware methods 
      can support better risk-based decisions.

    <p><strong>Summary of Matthew‚Äôs Post:</strong>  
      Matthew provided a detailed comparison of CVSS versions 3 and 4, noting improvements in contextual and supplemental metrics 
      but also persistent user-related inconsistencies. He proposed combining CVSS v4 with the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) 
      for a more balanced and predictive vulnerability management approach that considers both severity and exploitability.
    </p>
    <p><strong>My Response:</strong>  
      Your post gives a very comprehensive overview of how CVSS has evolved and why version 4.0 was introduced. 
      I found it interesting that you mentioned how around 30% of users still do not consult the CVSS user guide, 
      as noted by Wunder et al. (2024). That really highlights how much human error and inconsistent application 
      continue to affect the system even after multiple revisions. I also agree that although CVSS v4 introduces 
      contextual and supplemental metrics, its usefulness still depends on the user‚Äôs familiarity with the framework, 
      which limits its effectiveness (Aggarwal, 2023).
    </p>
    <p>
      Your suggestion to combine CVSS v4 with the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) is very practical. 
      As you noted, Tan et al. (2025) found that the two systems measure different dimensions of vulnerability management. 
      Combining them could provide both a technical severity rating and a data-driven likelihood of exploitation, 
      aligning with Aven and Thekdi (2024)‚Äôs view that quantitative and qualitative methods should complement each other 
      for balanced risk evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, your post successfully acknowledges that CVSS remains deeply embedded in industry practices 
      while recognising the need for improvement. Your balanced perspective between tradition and innovation 
      reflects a realistic understanding of how vulnerability management evolves in practice.

  <h3>Seminar Summary ‚Äì Quantitative Modelling Workshop (Parts 1 &amp; 2)</h3>
  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      The seminar extended the Unit 7 discussion into practical implementation of quantitative risk models.  
      In Part 1, participants examined how <strong>Monte Carlo simulation</strong> can estimate probability 
      distributions of project or system risk outcomes. The tutor demonstrated how selecting proper variable ranges 
      and sample sizes affects the accuracy of results and highlighted the importance of validating model assumptions 
      using historical data or expert judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Part 2, the focus shifted to <strong>Bayesian updating</strong> and real-time model refinement. 
      Students learned how new evidence‚Äîsuch as updated threat intelligence or vulnerability scans‚Äîcan dynamically 
      alter probability estimates. The discussion connected these principles with industry frameworks like ISO 27005 
      and NIST SP 800-30, emphasising iterative assessment and transparency. 
      The seminar concluded with a short exercise comparing CVSS, EPSS, and SSVC outputs, 
      showing how combined metrics offer a more robust approach to modern vulnerability prioritisation.

    <p><strong>Summary Post</strong><br>
    <em>by Pragadheesh Marimuthu ‚Äì Tuesday, 7 October 2025, 7:47 AM</em></p>

    <p>
      Although I reviewed the readings and forum threads throughout Units 7 to 9, I took some time to organise 
      my thoughts and decided to post my complete responses together after understanding the topic more clearly. 
      This approach allowed me to reflect holistically on how quantitative risk models and vulnerability scoring 
      systems interact in practice. Reading Spring et al. (2021) reshaped my view of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS). 
      I realised that the framework‚Äôs static nature and subjective scoring create limitations that can misrepresent 
      real-world risk (Sabottke, Suciu and Dumitra»ô, 2015). My initial post argued that the Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorisation (SSVC) 
      offers a more adaptive and transparent alternative by considering each stakeholder‚Äôs context, aligning 
      closely with ISO/IEC 27005 principles of continuous risk assessment (Aven and Thekdi, 2024).

      Engaging with peers helped me see the wider implications of these systems. Omar‚Äôs post deepened my 
      understanding of how SSVC‚Äôs decision trees allow for flexible, role-based prioritisation of vulnerabilities. 
      Matthew‚Äôs analysis, however, reminded me that CVSS remains deeply embedded in industry standards and that 
      version 4.0 introduces useful improvements through environmental and supplemental metrics. His suggestion to combine 
      CVSS v4 with the Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) highlighted how integrating predictive and traditional models 
      can lead to more accurate vulnerability management.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reflecting on the discussion as a whole, I learned that there is no single perfect model for assessing risk. A balanced approach 
      that combines empirical data, contextual awareness, and adaptive evaluation methods provides the most realistic foundation 
      for effective cybersecurity decision-making.

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
<p>
  This unit reinforced how <strong>quantitative risk modelling</strong> from earlier weeks directly supports 
  <strong>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR)</strong> planning. I learned that the accuracy of continuity strategies 
  depends on translating analytical results ‚Äî such as vulnerability likelihoods and impact scores ‚Äî into 
  <em>operational recovery metrics</em> like RTO and RPO. Reading and forum engagement helped me understand that 
  frameworks such as <strong>CVSS</strong> and <strong>SSVC</strong> are not isolated scoring systems, but vital 
  inputs for prioritising which business processes, assets, or services should recover first after a disruption. 
</p>

<p>
  Peer discussions also shaped my appreciation of how <strong>context and stakeholder roles</strong> influence recovery decisions. 
  For example, I realised that a single numerical score cannot represent the unique recovery requirements of 
  suppliers, operators, or asset owners. Combining quantitative indicators with context-driven approaches 
  such as SSVC or EPSS creates a more balanced recovery strategy that reflects both <em>probability</em> and <em>practical urgency</em>. 
  This perspective aligns closely with the <strong>ISO/IEC 27005</strong> emphasis on iterative, evidence-based 
  risk treatment. 
</p>

<p>
  Overall, Unit 9 taught me to view BC/DR not as an isolated phase but as the <strong>actionable extension 
  of the risk management process</strong>. Effective continuity planning integrates analytical rigour, 
  stakeholder communication, and real-world testing. The ability to connect vulnerability data to tangible 
  recovery priorities ‚Äî such as backup validation, dependency mapping, and documented response playbooks ‚Äî 
  is what transforms theoretical risk models into sustainable resilience practices.

  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p>
    This unit deepened my understanding of how <strong>analytical risk modelling supports recovery engineering</strong>. 
    By examining Sutton (2021) and Popov et al. (2021), I learned to justify RTO and RPO through tangible business-impact data. 
    The seminar clarified how hybrid DR architectures and cloud portability strategies minimise lock-in risk while sustaining
    resilience.  Integrating Monte Carlo simulation into DR planning showed me how probabilistic models can 
    quantify uncertainty in downtime and data loss.  Overall, Unit 10 helped me connect theory to practice by 
    linking risk evaluation, recovery testing, and governance into a unified continuity framework.

    Through this unit and the Executive Summary project, I learned how <strong>quantitative modelling</strong> 
    and <strong>future-trend analysis</strong> complement each other. Monte Carlo and Bayesian techniques 
    revealed the uncertainty behind supply-chain reliability, while trend research on AI, 
    automation, and multi-cloud adoption helped me design realistic, testable recovery solutions.  
    I now see that anticipating the future of SRM is less about prediction and more about 
    <em>adaptive validation</em> ‚Äî continuously refining assumptions, auditing DRaaS performance, 
    and aligning metrics with evolving standards like ISO 22301 and 27031.  
    This iterative mindset strengthened both my analytical and strategic confidence 
    in designing resilient systems for real-world organisations.

    Over twelve units I moved from checklist security to an evidence-led SRM practice that connects threat
    modelling, probabilistic analysis, and continuity engineering. Early units built shared language and user-centred
    risk discovery; mid-module, STRIDE/PASTA and critiques of CVSS pushed me toward SSVC/EPSS for context-aware
    decisions; later, Monte Carlo and Bayesian reasoning grounded DR objectives (RTO/RPO) in quantified uncertainty.
    The outcome is a repeatable approach: state assumptions, model uncertainty, validate via BC/DR tests, and
    communicate decisions transparently to stakeholders. Read the full 1,000-word reflection below.

  <h2>Reflective Summary (Units 1‚Äì12)</h2>
  <p>
    This module shifted my view of SRM from checklist compliance to a <strong>decision science</strong> that links
    uncertainty, controls, and business outcomes. Early units (U1‚ÄìU2) showed how <strong>user participation</strong> and
    clear risk language reduce blind spots in the Risk Management Process. Threat modelling (U3‚ÄìU4) moved me from
    ad-hoc lists to <strong>structured analysis</strong> (STRIDE, attack trees) with traceability from threat ‚Üí control
    ‚Üí business impact.
  </p>
  <p>
    In U7‚ÄìU9, I learned to treat numbers as <em>transparent estimates</em>, not truth. I internalised critiques of
    <strong>CVSS</strong> (subjectivity, static scoring) and the value of <strong>SSVC</strong> decision trees and
    <strong>EPSS</strong> exploit probability. Critically, I translated analytics into <strong>BC/DR</strong> targets:
    tested RTO/RPO, tiered recovery, and evidence of verification‚Äîturning scores into <em>actionable resilience</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    U10 consolidated DR design choices (hybrid/cloud patterns, DRaaS, vendor lock-in) and reinforced documenting
    <strong>assumptions and justifications</strong>. U11‚Äôs trends work strengthened my ability to separate hype from
    measurable value (AI-assisted detection/response, zero-trust adoption, SBOM-led supply-chain integrity, automated
    control verification). U12‚Äôs debate honed <strong>argumentation</strong>‚Äîstating why, how, and to what extent a
    trend will shape SRM in five years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Going forward I will: (1) pair qualitative judgement with quantitative evidence (SSVC&nbsp;+&nbsp;EPSS/Monte Carlo),
    (2) maintain a live standards-to-data-flow checklist, (3) express resilience in <strong>tested</strong> RTO/RPO terms,
    and (4) document uncertainty so decisions remain <strong>transparent, reproducible, and defensible</strong>. This
    e-portfolio captures that evolution‚Äîfrom foundational concepts to a practice grounded in evidence, clarity, and continuous learning.
